# What is STEAKSOL?

**STEAKSOL** is a liquid staking token representing SOL delegated to the SteakNet validator.

* Launched 1:1 with SOL
* Auto-compounding validator rewards
* **Exchange rate increases** each epoch as staking rewards accrue
* **Liquid**: swap back to SOL whenever you want
* Non-custodial: STEAKSOL remains in your wallet

> Think of STEAKSOL as the “receipt” that appreciates over time as staking rewards auto-compound in the validator.
