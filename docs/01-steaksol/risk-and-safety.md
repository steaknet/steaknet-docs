# ⚠️ Risks & Safety

* **Validator risk:** If the validator performs poorly or is slashed (rare on Solana), rewards may be lower.
* **Protocol risk:** Smart contract / program bugs can exist. Review code, use at your own discretion.
* **Market risk:** If secondary markets trade STEAKSOL, price can deviate from exchange value temporarily.
* **Custody:** SteakNet is non-custodial; always verify you’re interacting with the official app.

**Good practices**

* Double-check URLs and contract addresses.
* Start with small amounts if you’re new.
