# STEAK FAQ

### Where’s the team allocation?
There is none. **No team/VC/marketing wallets.** All circulating $STEAK is earned by the community.

### Why are you doing this?
We believe **staking is the heart of Solana**. $STEAK shifts attention back to staking and rewards the people who secure the network.

### How do I earn $STEAK?
Stake SOL with **STEAK.NET** → receive STEAKSOL → remain a loyal staker to receive periodic $STEAK distributions. No trading required.

### Do locks mean sell pressure?
No. Locks indicate **availability for airdrop emissions** on schedule, not a requirement to sell.

### What are the yearly emission shares?
Year 1: 36% · Year 2: 24% · Year 3: 12% · Year 4: 8% (of the 96B emission pool).
