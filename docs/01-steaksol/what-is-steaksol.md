# What is STEAKSOL?

**STEAKSOL** is a liquid staking token representing SOL delegated to the SteakNet validator.

- Launched 1:1 with SOL.
- **Exchange rate increases** each epoch as staking rewards accrue.
- **Liquid**: swap back to SOL (subject to validator/epoch mechanics) whenever you want.
- Non-custodial: keys remain in your wallet.

> Think of STEAKSOL as the “receipt” that appreciates over time as staking rewards compound in the validator.
