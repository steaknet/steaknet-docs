# ðŸ¥© What is $STEAK?

**$STEAK** is SteakNetâ€™s **community reward token**.\
Distributed every few epochs alongside staking rewards, itâ€™s our way to **align incentives with loyal stakers** as the SteakNet ecosystem grows.

**Why $STEAK exists**

* Reward the people who secure the network by staking.
* Encourage long-term participation, not speculation.
* Keep distribution community-driven (no team/VC/marketing allocations).
