# What is $STEAK?

**$STEAK** is SteakNet’s **community reward token**.  
Distributed every few epochs alongside staking rewards, it’s our way to **align incentives with loyal stakers** as the SteakNet ecosystem grows.

**Why $STEAK exists**
- Reward the people who secure the network by staking.
- Encourage long-term participation, not speculation.
- Keep distribution community-driven (no team/VC/marketing allocations).
