# What is SteakNet?

SteakNet is a Solana validator and staking ecosystem that makes staking fun, transparent, and rewarding.

* **Validator Service:** Professionally run with uptime and decentralization as priorities.
* **STEAKSOL:** A liquid staking token (LST) tied to staked SOL, earning validator yield + bonus rewards.
* **$STEAK:** A fair-launch community reward token, with no team allocations or VC bags.



**Mission:**

To strengthen Solana by rewarding loyal stakers and building a fun, steak-themed culture around staking.



**TL;DR**

* Stake SOL → receive STEAKSOL (liquid staking, redeemable).
* Each epoch, STEAKSOL’s exchange rate rises as validator rewards accrue.
* Loyal stakers periodically receive **$STEAK** on top, aligning incentives as SteakNet grows together with the community.
