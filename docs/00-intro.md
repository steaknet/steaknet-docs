# Welcome to SteakNet

SteakNet makes staking on Solana simple and tasty.

- **STEAKSOL** — your liquid stake receipt for delegations to the SteakNet validator.  
- **$STEAK** — community reward token distributed to loyal stakers over time.

**TL;DR**
- Swap SOL → receive STEAKSOL (liquid, redeemable).
- Each epoch, STEAKSOL’s exchange rate rises as validator rewards accrue.
- Loyal stakers periodically receive **$STEAK** on top, aligning incentives as SteakNet grows together with the community.

> Non-custodial. Your keys, your coins.
