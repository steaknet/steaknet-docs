# How it works

1. **Stake SOL**\
   Swap your SOL to STEAKSOL via the SteakNet site. Your SOL is delegated to the SteakNet validator.
2. **Receive STEAKSOL**\
   You get STEAKSOL in return. Over time, 1 STEAKSOL claims more SOL because the validator accrues rewards.
3. **Rewards Accrue**\
   Each epoch, the exchange rate STEAKSOL â†’ SOL increases. Additionally, **$STEAK** tokens are distributed to loyal stakers on a periodic schedule.
4. **Unstake when you wish**\
   Flip the swap direction to redeem STEAKSOL back into SOL&#x20;
